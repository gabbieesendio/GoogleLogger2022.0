# GoogleLogger2022.0

How it works ?

Google Logger is just like a keylogger. With this program you can easily see your logged google searches. Let's say you find what you search on google through a txt file and it will be automatically sent to you thru gmail.

Features:

* The search logs will save as txt file and automatically send to you thru gmail
* You see the date and time of logs
* Easy to use

Note: This is a pre-release version of Google Logger. This is under development and need some improvements.
